# Final Project Plan
For my final project, I will be creating a website for the business my family has owned for three generations, Union Hispana. 
They are focused on several types of social services which will be the inspiration for the different tabs on the website.
The goal for the layout will be the landing page, which will be an About page, and the five tabs; tax services, real estate, 
notary republic/CLSA, insurance, and LiveScan. Because this business has been in the family for years, I felt it was only natural to 
finally create a website to keep up with the ever-evolving technological times. I will be collaborating with my brother and father - the
ones who are currently running the office - for input regarding the information I need and the physical appearance of the website. In regards to the coding itself, I will need to become more familiar with Bootstrap and integrating it into my project.

The goal for the first tab, tax services, is to include some sort of a checklist for the documents needed when filing taxes, and other important information. The second tab, real estate, will include information about financing, areas of interest, current houses we have listed, and perhaps several testimonials. The tab for notary republic/CLSA will also include important information about how Union Hispana can help them as well as the tab for LiveScan.

Update: I have also added a sixth page, a contact page

My five tricks:
- a responsive top nav
- people cards for my family/"the team"
- contact form
- search bar with a cute button next to it
- cutout text with LA county in the background
