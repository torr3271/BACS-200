# Final Project Plan
For my final project, I will be creating a website for the business my family has owned for three generations. 
They are focused on several types of social services which will be the inspiration for the different tabs on the website.
The goal for the layout will be the landing page, which will be an About page, and the five tabs; tax services, real estate, 
notary republic/CLSA, insurance, and LiveScan. Because this business has been in the family for years, I felt it was only natural to 
finally create a website to keep up with the ever-evolving technological times.
