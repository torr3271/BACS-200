    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <h3>Technology use has increased in younger generations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>it is estimated that over 22% of adolescents log onto a social media website more than 10 times a day, and, with 75% of adolescents in general owning smartphones, this number is bound to increase</li>
        <li>the next generation is largely growing up on their phones and tablets, which causes their social and emotional development to be reliant on this as well</li>
        <li>young children have a limited sense of self-regulation and are especially impressionable which puts them at a higher risk of technologically induced psychological drawbacks</li>
        <li>the use of technology at an early age negatively impacts the psychological development of young brains in three main areas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Focus</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The starting point for all consequences, both positive and negative, is being able to even realize there is a problem</li>
        <li>Being able to focus on a subject is the foundation set before a child can begin to learn and think for themselves</li>
        <li>Wireless devices produce electromagnetic fields and pulsed radiofrequency radiation which have been documented to be especially detrimental to young people</li>
        <li>Technology has shifted the way young brains develop because of this</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Imagination</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus also has a direct impact on imagination, a skill which is required to form opinions and questions about the world around them</li>
        <li>Television and video games do the hard work of coming up with new ideas for them </li>
        <li>These pre-set conditions, then, inhibit the growth of the problem-solving skills imagination fosters</li>
        <li>This leaks into the way the child learns and may discourage them from learning altogether</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mental Illnesses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>children have their own “child culture” </li>
        <li>The constant use of social media, especially for children still figuring out who they are, can lead to a decrease in self-image and a much stronger need to feel accepted among their peers at an earlier age </li>
        <li>The culture between children is then tainted with depression and possible cases of bullying</li>
        <li>Children who are not yet capable of understanding the concept of depression should not already be feeling the effects of it</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>technology is not all bad and some professionals say it may enhance creative and communication skills and help children find their identity</li>
        <li>but, because technology can be so entertaining, children tend to focus less on what is being said and more on the pictures surrounding the text</li>
        <li>the habits of children are taught and are not pre-wired in their brains, which is why it is important to teach them healthy ones</li>

    </ul>
