                Jackson Stone recounts his experience in working with a boring interface, how this effected his workflow, and what he did about it.
                <ul>
                    <li>Stone had an amazing software development opportunity to make data analysis fun and engaging</li>
                    <li>The problem was that because the program he was working with was incredibly stale, his workflow was interrupted and he found himself easily distracted</li>
                    <li>He was able to create a really cool and interactive design where users could visualize their projects</li>
                    <li>In his design, you can fly, which is pretty cool</li>

                Author Chris Bailey demonstrates how our ability to focus is the key to productivity, creativity, and living a meaningful life, and helps us hone our own abilities to focus.
                <ul>
                    <li>Disturbed by how much time he spends on his phone, Bailey sets out to "get rid of it" and limit his phone usage to 30 minutes a day for month, and what he found was a longer attention span, more ideas, and more plans for the future</li>
                    <li>It's not that our brains are ditracted, it's that our brains are overstimulated and crave those nuggets of distraction</li>
                    <li>Ideas came more often because his mind was not busy focused on something and had more opportunity to wander</li>
                    <li>"The state of our attention determines the state of our lives"</li>
                </ul>

                With a captivating story, Jon Ronson illuminates just how blurry the line between the crazy and the sane actually is.
                <ul>
                    <li>The story starts when Ronson meets a group of Scientologists who are determined to prove psychiatry is a pseudoscience, and they can prove it with a man named Tony</li>
                    <li>When Tony was 17, he beat someone up and was given the idea to fake madness to avoid a harsh prison cell, but he faked it too well and was sent to the Broadmoor Hospital (for the criminally insane)</li>
                    <li>His clinician stated that while they accept he faked madness, they believe he is a psycopath because faking madness is just the type of cunning and manipulative act of a psycopath</li>
                    <li>He ends the story with Tony, finally out of Broadmoore, telling him, "Everyone is a bit psychopathic"</li>

                    <li>There is a famous quote which illustrates the naive idea that had blogs and the internet been around in the early 90's, the genocide in Rwanda never would have happened</li>

                    <li>In Thailand there is a website called Protect the King with the sole purpose of civilians submitting websites which might be offensive to the king (the offensive site then gets taken down within 24 hours)</li>
