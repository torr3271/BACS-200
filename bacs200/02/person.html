            One day in middle school, one of my favorite teachers showed us a documentary about the strength and preserverance needed to lift oneself out of horrible situations. Out of the struggle came success and the love needed to inspire others to do the same. Now a former pastor, Father Greg Boyle was witness to extreme gang violence during what is known as the "Decade of Death" where, at its peak, over 1000 people lost their lives to gang-related killings. In 1988, he and his parish started what would eventually become Homeboy Industries, which employs and trains former gang members in a range of social enterprises, as well as provides critical services to thousands of men and women who walk through its doors every year seeking a better life.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inclusive - they bring people together to strive for a greater purpose</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>

            Father Greg Boyle has received the California Peace Prize and been inducted into the California Hall of Fame. In 2014, the White House named Father Boyle a Champion of Change. He also received the University of Notre Dameâ€™s 2017 Laetare Medal, the oldest honor given to American Catholics.   He demonstrated that past violence does not dictate the good in people or their ability to create change in themselves. Today, Homeboy Industries is a lasting beacon of hope.
